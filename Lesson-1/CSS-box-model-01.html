    <h1>CSS Box model</h1>

    <p>The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: <b>content, padding, borders & margins</b>.</p>

    <p>The image below illustrates the box model:</p>

    <div>
      This text is the content of the box. We have added a 50px padding, 20px margin and a 15px green border.

      Some HTML elements like the paragraph element, headers h1-h6 elements have margin wrapping around them by default. You must remember this when working with these elements. There will be scenarios where a developer may need to remove the default margin or maybe even increase it to taste.
